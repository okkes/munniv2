# Getting the native apps running — your one-time checklist

Status 2026-07-15: **steps 1–3 are DONE** (repo variables set, native
Logto app created, Firebase json committed + FCM key on the NAS is the
only piece left there). What remains is finishing Play (step 4) and,
later, Apple (step 5).

## 1. GitHub repository variables — DONE ✓

`NATIVE_API_URL`, `NATIVE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, `NATIVE_LOGTO_ENDPOINT`,
`NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID`, `NATIVE_LOGTO_RESOURCE` are set. The resource is
the **API resource indicator** — the identifier of the API in Logto's
"API resources" (here `https://munni-api.<your-domain>`), which the
app requests access tokens FOR. Same value the web build uses as
`VITE_LOGTO_RESOURCE`.

Every master merge now produces, under **Actions → Native Android →
Artifacts**: `munni-android-debug` (sideloadable APK) and
`munni-android-release` (Play-ready signed .aab).

## 2. Logto — DONE ✓ (with a correction)

You were right to create a **separate Native-type application** instead
of reusing the SPA app — Logto validates redirect types per app kind,
and `munni://auth-callback` only fits a native app. The original
instruction here said otherwise; corrected. `NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID` now
carries the native app's id. One follow-up inside Logto: if the API
resource uses role-based access control, grant the native app the same
role as the SPA — without RBAC nothing more is needed.

## 3. Firebase — DONE ✓ (one NAS step left)

`google-services.json` is committed and the shell builds with the FCM
plugin active. Remaining: put the **service-account key** (Project
settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key) into the NAS
`.env` as ONE line, **wrapped in single quotes** (the JSON contains
spaces, which otherwise break scripts that read the file):

```
FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type": "service_account", "project_id": "munni-fb316", ...}'
```

Keep the `\n` sequences inside `private_key` exactly as Google exported
them. Then redeploy the api container and check
`https://munni-api.<domain>/health` — it reports `"fcm": true` only
when the key parses (project_id + client_email + private_key present).
Until then native devices register fine but receive no pushes.

## 3b. iOS push (added 2026-07-16) — your checklist

The "enable notifications → hangs → stays off" iOS bug is fixed in code
(AppDelegate now forwards the APNs registration callbacks the Capacitor
plugin waits for). For pushes to actually ARRIVE on iOS, Firebase needs
to know the iOS apps:

1. Firebase console → Project settings → **Add app → iOS**, bundle id
   **`app.munni`** → download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and replace the
   committed placeholder at
   `apps/native/ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info.plist`.
2. Repeat for **`app.munni.dev`** → save as
   `apps/native/ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info-Dev.plist` (CI swaps it
   in for the staging build).
3. Firebase console → Project settings → **Cloud Messaging → Apple app
   configuration**: upload an **APNs authentication key** (create at
   developer.apple.com → Keys → “+” → Apple Push Notifications service;
   one key covers both apps).

Until 1–3 are done the app degrades gracefully: registration succeeds
with a raw APNs token, but the server's FCM sender cannot deliver to it.

## 4. Google Play — account exists; three steps left

Signing is fully handled: an upload keystore was generated, lives in
the repo secrets (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*`) and as a local copy at
`deploy/env/upload.keystore` (gitignored; password in
`deploy/env/.env.local`). CI already produces the signed .aab.

1. **Create the app** in the Play Console (your Jinbu account): Create
   app → name "munni" → package name will bind on first upload. Note:
   the old `com.okkes.munni.preview` / `com.ashblossom.munni.preview`
   entries are the legacy prototype — this is a NEW app with package
   **`app.munni`**. Also register `app.munni` under the "Android
   developer verification" banner you're seeing.
2. **Upload the first .aab by hand** (Play's API cannot create apps):
   download `munni-android-release` from the latest master Actions run
   and drop it into Internal testing → Create release. Enable **Play
   App Signing** when asked (default) — our key is then just the upload
   key and can be reset if ever lost.
3. **Service account for CI uploads**: Play Console → Setup → API
   access → link a Google Cloud project → create a service account with
   the "Release manager" role → download its JSON key → save it as the
   repo secret `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`. From then on every master
   merge publishes to the internal track automatically.

## 5. iOS — DONE ✓ (TestFlight uploads work end-to-end)

Verified 2026-07-15: archive → cloud signing → TestFlight upload all
green on CI (run 29414308155). Two hard-won requirements are baked into
the workflow: the ASC key must be **Admin** role (see step 2), and
uploads must be built with the iOS 26 SDK — the workflow selects the
newest installed Xcode on the runner because the default is too old.
The steps below are kept for reference / re-setup:

1. **App record**: [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
   → Apps → **+ New App** → platform iOS, name "munni", bundle ID
   `app.munni` (register it as an explicit App ID when prompted), SKU
   `munni`.
2. **API key**: App Store Connect → Users and Access → **Integrations →
   App Store Connect API** → Team Keys → generate, role **Admin**. Note
   the Key ID + Issuer ID and download the `.p8` (one chance!).
   > ⚠ The role must be **Admin**, not App Manager. CI signs the build
   > with a *cloud-managed distribution certificate*, which only an
   > Admin key may create — an App Manager key fails the export with
   > "Cloud signing permission error / No signing certificate 'iOS
   > Distribution' found" (this is what the first TestFlight run hit).
   > Also make sure any pending agreements are accepted under
   > Business / Agreements, Tax, and Banking, or cert creation is blocked.
3. **Repo secrets**: `ASC_KEY_ID` (key id), `ASC_ISSUER_ID` (issuer),
   `ASC_KEY_P8` (the .p8 file base64-encoded:
   `base64 -w0 AuthKey_XXXX.p8`), `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (Membership page).
4. Flip the repo variable **`IOS_BUILD_ENABLED=true`** — the next
   master merge archives, signs and uploads build N to TestFlight.
   (With the variable on but no secrets, CI only does a cheap unsigned
   smoke build.)

Push on iOS additionally needs: Apple portal → Keys → create an
**APNs key**, upload it in Firebase → Project settings → Cloud
Messaging → Apple app configuration (add an iOS app with bundle
`app.munni` there first, and drop its `GoogleService-Info.plist` into
`apps/native/ios/App/App/` — tell me when it exists and I wire it in).

## 5b. Stop the "certificate revoked" emails — automated, no Mac (updated 2026-07-16)

Each CI run used to mint a fresh Apple Development certificate and a
cleanup script revoked the old ones — every revocation triggers an
Apple email. With a persistent certificate in the repo secrets, CI
reuses it and nothing is minted or revoked anymore.

No Mac needed (you don't have one): the **"Mint Apple signing
certificate"** workflow (`mint-apple-cert.yml`, manual dispatch) makes
the key + CSR with openssl, has the App Store Connect API sign it, and
uploads the encrypted `.p12` as a 1-day artifact. The
`APPLE_DEV_CERT_PASSWORD` secret was generated and set already; after a
dispatch, the artifact content goes into `APPLE_DEV_CERT_P12`
(`gh secret set APPLE_DEV_CERT_P12 < APPLE_DEV_CERT_P12.b64`). This was
run once on 2026-07-16 — rerun it only if the cert ever expires
(1 year) or gets revoked.

The workflow now takes an `environment` input (default `local`, added
for the wizard); on the NAS track dispatch it as is — repository-level
secrets are visible from any environment.

On the LOCAL track the wizard does all of this by itself (2026-09-08):
the first iOS build mints the certificate through the same workflow
(dispatched into the GitHub environment `local` — the workflow gained an
`environment` input for that), the helper pulls the run artifact back
into the machine store (`APPLE_DEV_CERT_P12` + `APPLE_DEV_CERT_PASSWORD`
+ the certificate's serial, family-wide like the upload keystore) and
the wizard ships both secrets into every repo's environment `local`
before each build, rewriting them so a stale same-name copy cannot
linger. Before a build the helper asks Apple by serial whether the
machine's certificate is still listed; a revoked or expired one is
forgotten and minted again without a click.

**One certificate per Apple team (learned 2026-09-09).** Development
certificates are team-wide, and the mint's cleanup of throwaway
certificates cannot tell a persistent one apart from junk — so the whole
team runs on ONE persistent certificate, and every place the secret
lives must hold the same p12: the repository-level secret (the hosted
track), each environment that overrides it (`staging`, `production`,
`local`), the machine store and every template copy's environment
`local`. The first wizard mint cleared the deck blindly, revoked the
hosted track's July certificate, and every hosted build after it
silently minted a throwaway (the imported p12 was dead and the prune
sweep was skipped in "persistent" mode) until Apple refused the twelfth.
Since then: the mint protects the certificate its environment still
holds (`PROTECT_SERIALS` in `asc-prune.js`), the iOS workflow reads the
p12's serial, fails fast with the repair when Apple no longer lists it
(`asc-cert-check.js`) and runs the prune as a sweep that revokes only
throwaways other builds left behind, and a wizard build on a repo that
already holds `APPLE_DEV_CERT_P12` at repository level does not mint at
all — the environment falls back to that secret.

## 6. The dedicated staging apps (`app.munni.dev`) — your checklist

The code side is DONE: an Android `dev` product flavor and an iOS
bundle-id override build **app.munni.dev** ("munni dev", deep-link
scheme `munni-dev://`) from every dev push — installable side by side
with the production app. It all activates with one switch: the repo
variable **`NATIVE_DEV_CHANNEL=true`**. Until then, dev pushes keep
building the prod flavor as artifacts and publish nothing.

Do these in order BEFORE flipping the variable:

1. **Firebase** (console → project munni-fb316 → Project settings →
   Your apps): **Add app → Android**, package name `app.munni.dev`.
   Then **re-download `google-services.json`** (it now contains both
   apps) and replace `apps/native/android/app/google-services.json` in
   the repo (commit it — tell me and I'll do it if you drop the file in
   the repo root). Without this the dev-flavor Gradle build fails.
2. **Play Console**: Create app → name **"munni dev"** → this app binds
   to package `app.munni.dev` on first upload. Then, like last time:
   download the `munni-android-release` artifact from a dev-branch
   Actions run (AFTER step 1 + the variable are done — or ask me to
   dispatch one) and upload it by hand to Internal testing → Create
   release, enabling Play App Signing. Finally Setup → API access →
   grant your existing CI service account **Release manager** on this
   app too (same `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, no new secret).
3. **App Store Connect**: Apps → **+ New App** → iOS, name **"munni
   dev"**, bundle ID `app.munni.dev` (register it as a new explicit App
   ID when prompted), SKU `munni-dev`. Nothing else — the same ASC API
   key signs and uploads it; TestFlight builds of the staging app land
   in this record.
4. **Logto** (admin console → the native application): add a second
   redirect URI **`munni-dev://auth-callback`**. (If you later create a
   separate Logto app for staging, put its id in the **staging GitHub
   Environment** as `NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID` — see below.)
5. Flip the variable **`NATIVE_DEV_CHANNEL=true`** (repo level, or in
   the staging environment) — the next dev push builds, signs and
   publishes app.munni.dev to its own Play internal track + TestFlight
   app.

**Per-stack configuration lives in GitHub Environments** (Settings →
Environments → `production` / `staging`): dev-branch jobs run in
`staging`, master jobs in `production`, and a variable defined there
overrides the repo-level variable of the SAME name (no more `_DEV`
suffixes). To point dev builds at the staging stack, define in the
staging environment: `NATIVE_API_URL=https://munni-test-api.<your-domain>`,
`NATIVE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://munni-test.<your-domain>`,
`NATIVE_LOGTO_RESOURCE=https://munni-test-api.<your-domain>`.
When a name is absent there, the repo-level (production) value applies.

Export compliance: answered once and encoded — Info.plist carries
`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` ("None of the algorithms": munni
only uses the OS's TLS/crypto), so the TestFlight popup won't return.

## 7. Crash reporting per platform (GlitchTip) — your checklist

CI bakes a GlitchTip DSN into each build, so crashes separate cleanly
by project. In GlitchTip (org **munni** → Create new project, platform
"Browser JavaScript" for the clients, ".NET" for the api), create:

| Project | DSN goes into | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `pwa-production` | variable `VITE_GLITCHTIP_DSN` | env production |
| `pwa-staging` | variable `VITE_GLITCHTIP_DSN` | env staging |
| `android-production` | variable `NATIVE_GLITCHTIP_DSN_ANDROID` | env production |
| `android-staging` | variable `NATIVE_GLITCHTIP_DSN_ANDROID` | env staging |
| `ios-production` | variable `NATIVE_GLITCHTIP_DSN_IOS` | env production |
| `ios-staging` | variable `NATIVE_GLITCHTIP_DSN_IOS` | env staging |
| `api-production` | secret `NAS_API_SENTRY_DSN` | env production |
| `api-staging` | secret `NAS_API_SENTRY_DSN` | env staging |

DSNs are not secret (client ones ship inside public JS bundles), so
variables are fine; only the api's rides the env render, which reads
secrets — hence `NAS_API_SENTRY_DSN` stays a secret. If a repo-level
`NAS_API_SENTRY_DSN` exists, delete it after adding the env-scoped
ones. Missing/empty DSN = that platform simply doesn't report.

Note the telemetry policy still applies on top: offline/demo identities
never send anything; signed-in users queue crash reports offline.

## 8. Separate Logto apps per platform — prepared

The workflows now prefer per-platform variables and fall back to the
shared `NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID` until you create the apps:

1. Logto console → Create application → **Native**, name "munni
   Android", redirect URIs `munni://auth-callback` AND
   `munni-dev://auth-callback` → its App ID becomes repo variable
   **`NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID_ANDROID`**.
2. Same again as "munni iOS" → **`NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID_IOS`**.
3. Delete the old shared `NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID` variable (and the old
   shared native app in Logto once no released build still uses it —
   safest a release cycle later).

Repo-level is fine for these (same app id serves prod + staging;
scope them per environment only if you later want staging-only Logto
apps).

## 9. The LOCAL store channels (added 2026-08-28) — wizard-managed

Every LOCAL ENVIRONMENT is its own store identity beside prod and dev:
**`app.munni.local.<env>`** ("munni <env>", `munni-local[-<env>]://`,
the staging icon) — Android product flavor `local` (own
`src/local/google-services.json` stub), rebranded per environment by CI
(`sed` over the stub + shortcuts before the build; iOS generalizes the
bundle-id rebrand the same way, associated domains stripped — the LAN
app claims no universal links; auth returns ride the scheme). **Push is
wired as code** (2026-09-08): pressing Build runs the wizard's
`firebase-setup` — the Play service account's own Cloud project is
Firebase-enabled via the Management API, the env's Android/iOS apps are
registered there, and `native-config` hands CI the real
google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist
(`NATIVE_GOOGLE_SERVICES_B64` / `NATIVE_IOS_FIREBASE_PLIST_B64`) to
bake over the stubs; the same service account doubles as the FCM
sender (auto-copied into `NAS_FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, and the env is
re-rendered + brought up again whenever its api does not carry it yet —
`/health` must answer `fcm: true`, found live 2026-09-08: the stored
credential never reached a running api). The Firebase apps are named
`munni local <env> android|ios` (the Apple App ID `munni local <env>`)
so the local track reads apart from the hosted twins. One-time
floors: grant that service account the **Firebase Admin** AND the
**Service Usage Admin** roles in IAM — adding Firebase to a Cloud
project switches APIs on, which Google gates behind
`serviceusage.services.enable`, a permission Firebase Admin does NOT
carry (found live 2026-09-08; by hand instead: add Firebase to the
project once in the Firebase console, then Firebase Admin alone is
enough) — and for iOS push upload the APNs key once (Firebase console
→ Cloud Messaging). Until then the stub keeps builds green with push
inactive and the Android card's push pill names the exact blocker.
iOS push in full (the wizard's iOS card carries the same fold): create
an APNs key at developer.apple.com → Keys (tick APNs; the same `.p8`
may carry Sign in with Apple), upload it in the Firebase console →
project → Cloud Messaging → Apple app configuration for
`munni local <env> ios` (Key ID + Team ID — no API exists for this),
then on the iPhone switch notifications on in munni's settings: nothing
registers by itself, and the simulator cannot receive push. A missing
APNs key surfaces in the api log as `THIRD_PARTY_AUTH_ERROR`.
Sign in with Apple works on the local track too (2026-09-08): LAN mode
serves real https, which Apple demands — tick the feature (LAN mode
follows by itself), paste the Services ID + key in step 3 (family-wide),
and register every environment's return URL
`https://munni-<env>-logto.<ip-dashed>.sslip.io/callback/apple-universal`
in the Services ID (the Apple card lists them; a changed wifi address
changes them). Headless re-renders feed the stored social credentials to
the Logto connector module, so the wizard's values are not needed.

Both native workflows accept `environment: local` + `localEnv: <env>`
(+ Android: `publish: auto|skip`) on dispatch and then build against
the machine's LAN family. The wizard's local track drives everything:
it turns on **LAN mode** — the family re-renders onto REAL https
hostnames `https://munni-<env>.<ip-dashed>.sslip.io` behind one family
Caddy with a locally-minted CA (localhost keeps working alongside;
Enable Banking consents work locally because the redirect is genuine
https) — writes `NATIVE_API_URL`/`NATIVE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`/
`NATIVE_LOGTO_*`/DSNs into the GitHub environment `local`, dispatches
the build — and DELIVERY GOES THROUGH THE STORES like every other
channel:

- **Android** → Play **internal testing** track, auto-published once
  `NATIVE_LOCAL_CHANNEL_<ENV>=true` (env `local` variable, the wizard's
  per-environment "Enable auto-publish" button; the wizard resolves it
  into the dispatch's `publish` input — until then builds pass with the
  upload skipped, no red runs). The store-mandated first upload stays
  manual ONCE PER ENVIRONMENT: the wizard downloads the signed `.aab`
  from the first green build → Play Console → create app
  `app.munni.local.<env>` → Internal testing → upload → grant the CI
  service account.
- **iOS** → TestFlight, after the one-time App Store Connect record per
  environment (New App, bundle `app.munni.local.<env>`). Until that
  record exists the export dies with `error: exportArchive Error
  Downloading App Information` — the local channel degrades it to a
  warning (skipped-not-red, like Android's first upload) and the
  wizard's ASC pill + build verdict name the missing record with the
  exact bundle id. Local builds number themselves in seconds since
  2026-01-01 (redispatching the same commit must not reuse a TestFlight
  build number — same practice as the Android versionCode). The iOS
  bundle id has its OWN wizard field and CI variable
  (`NATIVE_LOCAL_APP_ID_IOS`, falling back to the Android id): Play
  burns package names when an upload key is lost while ASC records live
  on, so Android may roll to `prod2` while iOS keeps `prod`. The
  export additionally needs the ASC key to hold cloud-signing rights —
  role **Admin** (or App Manager + "Access to Cloud Managed
  Distribution Certificate"); without it the export fails with `Cloud
  signing permission error` / `No signing certificate "iOS
  Distribution"`, and CI names that fix. Creating the app RECORD stays
  manual at BOTH stores by design of their APIs (automation like
  fastlane produce drives an interactive Apple-ID session with 2FA —
  not CI-able); a pending Program License Agreement must be accepted by
  the Account Holder or store operations fail account-wide.

Phones must trust the family's CA once per device (download
`http://ca.<ip-dashed>.sslip.io` → root.crt). Android: install it as a
CA certificate (Settings → Security). iPhone: the download lands as a
PENDING profile — Settings → **Profile Downloaded** (or General → VPN &
Device Management) → Install, then Settings → General → About →
**Certificate Trust Settings** → full trust; both steps, or the in-app
OIDC discovery fetch dies on TLS and the sign-in button appears dead
(2026-09-08 report — the login screen now surfaces that failure with
the exact hint). The local Android flavor ships a
`network_security_config` that trusts user-installed CAs for exactly
this; hosted flavors stay system-CAs-only.

Caveats, stated in the wizard too: the build bakes the LAN hostnames (a
DHCP change changes them — reserve the address), and it only works on
that wifi. Deleting an environment (or everything) cascades: containers
\+ volumes, its GoCardless consents, its vault folder, its auto-publish
flag — plus an OPT-IN store retirement (offered when step-3 store
credentials exist): the Play internal-testing track is cleared and the
TestFlight builds are expired, so testers lose the app immediately.
What no API can do: delete the store RECORDS — the Play app record, the
ASC app record and the burned package name stay (remove never-published
records by hand in the consoles; a later build re-publishes under the
same identity). One exception: an `app.munni.local.*` bundle id that
never got its ASC app record IS deleted from the developer portal.
Delete-everything ends with a **cleanup verification**: containers,
volumes, networks (matched by compose project `munni-local-*` — the
from-source dev loop, project `munni-local`, and munni-sonar don't
count), rendered folders, the registry and the LAN marker must all be
gone; only then does the Delete button retire. The step-3 credential
store and the upload keystore's reset certificate survive on purpose.

## What works today

The debug APK runs fully offline (demo/offline identities), keeps data
forever (app-scoped storage), uses munni:// deep links, and — once the
FCM key is on the NAS — receives pushes. Native sign-in works as soon
as the app is built with the new `NATIVE_LOGTO_APP_ID` (next master
merge).
