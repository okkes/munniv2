# infra/ — from zero to a running munni pair, step by step

**Start here: open `infra/setup/index.html` in your browser** (straight
from the checkout — no server, no install). The setup wizard walks this
whole document interactively: it explains every third-party account,
stores the secrets for you (client-side sealed-box encryption, straight
to the GitHub API), runs the bootstrap and deploy workflows at the click
of a button, and shows live per-step status. It only ever talks to
api.github.com; the PAT you paste stays in the tab's memory.

The text below is the same flow as prose — the fallback and the
reference. The NAS and Raspberry Pi tracks share Part A and split in
Part B; the **local track** (full ecosystem on Docker Desktop) is
self-contained in the wizard and in `runbook.munni-local.md` after a
`node infra/bootstrap.mjs --stack munni-local`.

> The NAS domain is a SECRET here (public repo): wherever you see
> `<domain>`, that's the value of the `IAC_DOMAIN` secret.

---

## Part A — shared groundwork (once ever)

**A1. Repo secrets.** The wizard's step 0–3 create all of these for you
(GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → *Repository*
secrets, if doing it by hand):

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `IAC_DOMAIN` | your DDNS domain (e.g. `xxxx.synology.me`) |
| `IAC_GH_PAT` | fine-grained PAT, THIS repo, permissions: Administration RW + Secrets RW + Variables RW + Actions RW (bootstrap writes environment secrets — `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot; the wizard also dispatches workflows with it) |
| `SYNOLOGY_URL` / `_USER` / `_PASS` / `_PATH` | DSM deploy account (FileStation + reverse-proxy writes; admin rights, 2FA off) — shared with deploy-nas.yml |
| `NAS_GHCR_PAT` | PAT with read:packages (image pulls) |
| `NAS_GOCARDLESS_SECRET_ID` / `_KEY` | GoCardless portal |
| optional: `NAS_ENABLEBANKING_*`, `NAS_FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, `NAS_LOGODEV_*`, `LOGTO_GOOGLE_*`, `LOGTO_APPLE_*` | as per feature |

`infra/secrets.manifest.json` is the authoritative inventory (owners,
scopes, platform tags); `bootstrap --verify` fails loudly on drift and
the wizard cross-checks its own coverage against it.

**A2. First bootstrap run.** Wizard step 4 — or Actions → *IaC
bootstrap* → Run workflow → stack `munni-iac-prod`, then
`munni-iac-staging`. It creates the `iac-production`/`iac-staging`
environments, mints every generated secret (postgres, VAPID, GlitchTip
key…), renders compose+env and uploads them plus a personalized
`runbook.<stack>.md` as the run artifact; the bootstrap output also
lands in the run's step summary. **The runbook artifact is your
worksheet for everything below.**

**A3. DNS.** With Synology DDNS the `*.<domain>` wildcard already
resolves; external registrars need records for the hosts listed in the
runbook (`munni-iac.<domain>`, `munni-iac-test.<domain>`, …).

---

## Part B1 — NAS track

**B1-1 (once per NAS).** Make sure the deploy account (SYNOLOGY_USER)
has DSM *administrator* rights — the reverse-proxy module needs them.
The IaC workflow creates every reverse-proxy rule via the DSM API. Only
two things stay manual (the workflow's verify step probes both):
- Firewall: allow `172.16.0.0/12` in the access profile; restrict the
  `*-admin` hosts to LAN.
- Certificate: the `*.synology.me` wildcard from DSM covers the hosts;
  for own domains run acme.sh with the `synology_dsm` deploy hook (see
  docs/iac-plan.md §4).

**B1-2 (once per stack — one workflow click).** Wizard step 5, or
Actions → *Deploy to NAS* → Run workflow → channel `iac-prod` /
`iac-staging` / `iac-both`. The workflow renders the stack from its
GitHub Environment (secrets AND written-back variables), publishes the
bundle via FileStation, and the NAS poller unpacks it into
`/volume1/docker/<stack>/` and runs `docker compose up -d` there. No
SSH, no manual copying.

## Part B2 — Raspberry Pi track (after PI3 lands)

**B2-1 (once per Pi).** Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit), attach an
SSD (Postgres on SD cards dies young), then run
`deploy/pi/install.sh` — it installs docker + compose, creates
`/opt/munni`, and arms the systemd bundle-poll timer. *(install.sh is
slice PI3 of docs/raspberry-pi-plan.md — until it lands, this track
is not yet available; the wizard shows it as planned.)*

**B2-2 (once per stack).** Same artifact files to `/opt/munni/<stack>/`,
`docker compose up -d`. The bundled Caddy (PI4) terminates HTTPS with
Let's Encrypt — no DSM, no reverse-proxy console, DNS must point at
the Pi.

---

## Part C — auth + observability (once per PAIR)

Social sign-in stays a paste, by provider design: Google has no API that
creates a consent screen or an OAuth client (only Identity-Aware-Proxy
clients, unusable for sign-in) and Apple's App Store Connect API stops
at bundle ids, certificates and profiles (no Services IDs, no keys). The
wizard does everything around it: the Google card deep-links both
console pages into the Play service account's project, both cards list
every environment's callback (domain + return URL for Apple) with copy
buttons, the Apple Team ID is taken from the TestFlight card, and
Check/Save ask Google and Apple whether each callback is registered —
both authorization endpoints judge a redirect without a user, so a
missing one is named before the first sign-in ever fails.

**C1. Logto OOBE (the ONE manual auth step).** Wizard step 6 — open
`https://logto-iac-admin.<domain>` → create the admin user →
Applications → Create → *Machine-to-machine* → name `infra` → assign
the Logto Management API role (all permissions). Paste its id/secret
into the wizard (it stores them in BOTH iac environments), or:

```sh
gh secret set IAC_LOGTO_INFRA_M2M_ID --env iac-production   # and --env iac-staging
gh secret set IAC_LOGTO_INFRA_M2M_SECRET --env iac-production
```

Re-run the IaC workflow for BOTH stacks — apps, redirect URIs, CORS,
API resources and the account-deletion M2M app are now code, and the
ids land in the GitHub environments automatically. Deploy again so the
frontends pick them up (they read runtime config from their container
env — one public image serves every stack).

**C2. Google sign-in (optional, once).** Google Cloud console →
Credentials → Create OAuth client (Web) → authorized redirect URI
`https://logto-iac.<domain>/callback/google-universal` → store
`LOGTO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `LOGTO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (the wizard's Google tile)
→ re-run the workflow. The connector + sign-in-experience wiring is code.

**C3. Apple sign-in (optional, once).** Apple developer portal →
Identifiers → new *Services ID* (this is `LOGTO_APPLE_CLIENT_ID`),
enable Sign in with Apple, return URL
`https://logto-iac.<domain>/callback/apple-universal`; Keys → new key
with Sign in with Apple → store `LOGTO_APPLE_TEAM_ID`,
`LOGTO_APPLE_KEY_ID`, `LOGTO_APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY` (the .p8 contents) →
re-run the workflow.

**C4. GlitchTip (one account + one token).** Wizard step 7 — open
`https://glitchtip-iac.<domain>` → register the first account → profile
→ Auth Tokens → create → store as `IAC_GLITCHTIP_API_TOKEN` (both iac
environments). Re-run the workflow: the glitchtip module creates the
org + per-stack projects and writes every DSN back itself
(`NAS_API_SENTRY_DSN` secret, `VITE_GLITCHTIP_DSN`/`_ADMIN` variables).

---

## Part D — native apps (store-mandated manual firsts)

Wizard step 9, or the runbook's §5: dispatch `native-android.yml` /
`native-ios.yml` with the `environment` input set to `iac-production`,
upload the first `.aab` to a new Play app (`app.munni.iac`) and create
the ASC record for TestFlight. Every build after the first is CI.

---

## The local track (full ecosystem on one machine)

**Double-click `infra/setup/start.cmd`** (or `node infra/setup/serve.mjs`).
That starts the wizard's LOCAL HELPER: it serves the same page on
127.0.0.1 and gives it hands — the page then stores the values you paste
(gitignored local store, GitHub not involved), runs bootstrap and
`docker compose` for you, streams every step's output live, and offers
one-click buttons for the dev stack and the tooling containers
(SonarQube + analyze, e2e stack, WebKit lane). The helper executes only
a fixed command allowlist, binds to 127.0.0.1, and requires the per-run
token it injects into the page.

The same flow by hand, if you prefer a terminal:

```sh
$env:NAS_GHCR_PAT = '<read:packages PAT>'
node infra/bootstrap.mjs --stack munni-local
cd infra/rendered/munni-local
docker compose --env-file .env.munni-local -f docker-compose.munni-local.yml up -d
```

Secrets are minted into `infra/rendered/munni-local/.secrets.local.json`
(gitignored, stable across re-runs); the rendered `.env` carries real
values. The generated `runbook.munni-local.md` walks the Logto OOBE and
GlitchTip token steps against `localhost`. This is distinct from the
from-source DEV stack (`deploy/docker-compose.local.yml`) — the wizard's
local track covers both.

### How the page is organised (2026-09-09)

Two levels, mirroring how the machine store routes values: the
**family** (credentials once per machine, grouped by kind; the shared
services, network mode and updater) and one **workspace per
environment** with Overview, Registrations (the Google/Apple callbacks
and the Enable Banking redirect that carry that environment's name,
verified with the provider), Phones (its Android/iOS builds and store
records) and Access tabs. A sticky stepper and a status rail read the
same facts and name the next step. Design: `docs/wizard-family-env-plan.md`.

Since 2026-09-10 features and their accounts are ONE step of **tiles**
(*Features & accounts*): it opens with an **Integration health** card —
one line per integration the picked features need, its state (Needs
setup · Configured · Checked ✓ · Needs attention · Check failed ·
Optional · Skipped), and *Check all*, which has the helper re-verify
every saved value against its provider without the page seeing a
secret — followed by one grid: a tile per connection (GitHub, the
registry; domain and Synology on the NAS track) and a tile per feature
(brand mark, toggle, one-line purpose, tags, the chip of its account).
*Manage* on a tile opens that account in place — what the service is,
why munni needs it, where the values come from, the fields, Save /
Check / Skip — one tile at a time so the grid stays a grid; *Select
recommended* turns the recommended set on. Optional integrations (the
crash-mail SMTP url) never count as blocking, and *Skip for now* counts
an integration as done everywhere (chip, health, rail, stepper) until a
value is saved or the skip is undone. The header, the stepper and the
output drawer share the main column's width.

### Day-2 on the local track: it keeps itself up to date

The wizard is a ONE-TIME bootstrap. Afterwards the helper is the PC's
counterpart of the NAS deploy poller (nothing can push to a PC, so it
pulls): with **automatic updates** on (card in step 4) it fetches the
checkout's branch every 10 minutes, fast-forwards when the working tree
is clean (a dirty dev checkout pauses the pull and says so — run the
autonomous helper from a clean clone), re-renders every stack from the
machine store after a pull, pulls the newest image of each channel
(channel tags move; `up` alone never re-pulls), brings the family up and
restarts itself when its own code moved. **Run the helper at logon**
registers a Task Scheduler entry (current user, no admin) that starts
`infra/setup/autonomy.cmd` minimized, without a browser tab. The machine
store never leaves the PC. Native apps update through the stores on
their own; the machine-owned Apple Development certificate (minted once
by the first iOS build through `mint-apple-cert.yml`, shared by the whole
Apple team — the hosted repo-level secret, every environment and the
machine store hold the same p12; CI refuses to build with a revoked one
instead of minting throwaways, and the wizard re-mints by itself when
Apple no longer lists it) keeps CI from minting and revoking throwaway
certificates.

## Day-2: how it stays healthy

- Pushes touching `infra/` run the module tests and VERIFY both stacks
  in CI (no writes).
- Manual dispatch of *IaC bootstrap* re-applies a stack idempotently;
  its output lands in the run's step summary.
- The `rotate` input (or `--rotate NAME`) re-mints a generated secret;
  redeploy afterwards.
- Retrieving generated passwords: see docs/secrets-access-plan.md —
  GitHub secrets are write-only by design.
- Local track: the helper's update loop (above) — its card shows the
  last verdict (pulled / paused and why / containers recreated), and
  "Check for updates now" runs one cycle on demand.
